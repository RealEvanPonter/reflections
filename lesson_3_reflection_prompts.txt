When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Anytime you are working with a group of people where you want to centrally locate your committed files, you should use the
remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on a separate feature or branch and don't want to change the tip of your branch by pulling in
what exists on GitHub. You also might be working on a team and wouldn't want your teammates work conflicting with
your own.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are cloning a repository on GitHub. Clones exist between GitHub and Local repositories, or between Local
Repositories. Branches are a separate string of commits that can exist anywhere. These branches are used to segment code
so that you can be working on features or fix bugs.
