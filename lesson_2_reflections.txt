What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a .git file is created. This will start tracking the files after you run the "git add" command.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is separate from the other locations, and allows you to have a space to work on specific files and keep
their commits together.
